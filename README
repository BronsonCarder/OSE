OSE - Oblivion Save Editor

Intro
-----
This is a working save editor (very early stages) that can import save files
from The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion game. Currently the only thing that can be
edited are the player's base attributes, but more is planned for future
versions.

Platforms supported
-------------------
In theory this should work on both XBox360 and PC saves, however only XBox360
saves have been tested so far. The only caveat is that the save file needs to
be extracted from the Container file before you can edit it. This can be done
using a program such as Le Fluffie. After editing the save file needs to be
injected back into the container file, again Le Fluffie can help, and then the
container file needs to be rehashed and resigned. I'm not going to go into the
details as there are plenty of good tutorials on the internet on how to do
this.

Usage
-----
The save file to be edited needs to be saved into the same directory as the OSE
executable and it needs to be named gamedata.dat (this will be user selectable
in future versions). Running OSE will cause the save file to be read in, you
can edit the player's base attributes at this point. Clicking save will create
a new savefile in the New directory (this too will be user selectable in future
versions)
